### DayOneLog

If you want something to log to Day One there are better things out there. Try [Brett Terpstra's Slogger](https://github.com/ttscoff/Slogger) or [Gifttdy](http://giftttdy.gadgetcoma.com).

This is my first attempt at writing something I might actually use (since 2007, anyway). When done it should take all the txt files in a directory, consolidate them and chuck them into Day One.

It's a work in progress, and may never be finished. But no-one's reading this, are they?
